# About :grimacing:

I identify as a programmer, aspie, metalhead and math geek.

# Special Interests :nerd_face:

- Pure mathematics (category theory, HoTT, topos theory, etc etc)
- Complex systems, complex networks
- Computational neuroscience and computational biology

## Other weird stuff

- HPCs, NUMA, distributed computing
- Embedded systems & IOT
- Occult (hence the handle)
- Board games
- Graphic novels (cyberpunk, dadaism, surrealism, post-apocalyptic)

# Job :briefcase:

At work I do:

- Architecture
- Data Science, ML, Deep Learning, NLP
- Backend applications development
- Data Engineering
- Devops

Apart from management, embedded, frontend, IOT and whatnot I do or have done in the past.
